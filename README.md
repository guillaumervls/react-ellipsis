React Ellipsis
==============

*[React](http://facebook.github.io/react) ellipsis component*

# Getting started

### Classic :

The "ready to use" [script file](https://raw.github.com/guillaumervls/react-ellipsis/master/dist/react-ellipsis.min.js)
is in the `dist` folder.

Then :
```html
<script src='react-ellipsis.min.js'></script>
<script>
  var Ellipsis = React.addons.Ellipsis;
</script>
```

### [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) :
Ì€
Install : `npm install react-ellipsis`

Then :
```javascript
Ellipsis = require('react-ellipsis')(React);
```

### Also works with AMD (e.g [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org))

In this case, it will depend on `react`.


# Use in JSX

```html
<Ellipsis component={React.DOM.div}> <!-- component defaults to <div> -->
  text
</Ellipsis>
```
Note that it is your responsiblity to size and style the `<Ellipsis>` component.


## (Re)build

```
npm install
grunt dist
```

## Run tests

```
npm install
grunt test

# or automatically re-run during development
grunt watch

# or run in the browser
grunt browserify:test
# now open test/react-ellipsis.test.html in your browser
```
